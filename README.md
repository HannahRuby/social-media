Build a social network
Overview
With authenticated users, we now have the ability to create user profiles and content that is associated with those users.

That means we can build complete user generated websites with users and associated content. We can build a social network.

The relationship between users on a social network is a junction table follows with two user_ids. A follower_id and a followee_id. This table allows you to look up all the followers or followees of a particular user. From there, you can load their posts and comments.
